* Introduction
** Debug and Visibility Project
For years, the ability for CEE, partner engineers, and developers has been
severely impacted by the lack of debug and diagnostics tools.  This results
in slower turnaround time to get fixes both upstream, and to customers.  It
also impairs the ability to report issues upstream when fixes aren't 
immediately obvious.

The purpose of this project is to expand the debug and diagnostic information
available to developers and support engineers such that they can quickly
report, troubleshoot, and correct customer issues in the field.

** Goals
The following are goals of the project:

*** Improve documentation
*** Develop scripts and other meaningful diagnostic tools
*** Enhance / add logs
*** Add hooks and tracepoints to the system
